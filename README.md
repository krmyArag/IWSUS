# The development and validation of an Inhomogeneous Wind Scheme for Urban Street
A model for wind profile calculation at typical positions of a long street.

Inhomogeneous Wind Scheme for Urban Street (IWSUS) is developed for genrating wind profiles at typical position of a long street. The IWSUS.m file includes the equations of these wind profiles and am example for a daily variation of heat flux with the use of daily urban surface temperature data in data folder.

\
The CFD_settings is the setting files for CFD simulations in OpenFOAM-v8.
\
The IWSUS-V0.1 contains IWSUS source code (module*iwsus*) and coupled with SLUCM in WRF as an example.
