The setting files in OpenFOAM for different scenerios are listed in
perpendicular and parallel folders seperately. For each subfolder, the name is
specified with different inflow or different building height. For example,
u1h20 means the inflow of the case is 1m/s perpendicular to the street with
building heights 20m (v for parallel). The *U* files in SingleGraph are the
data used for fitting.
