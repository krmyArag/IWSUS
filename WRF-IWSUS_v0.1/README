IWSUS
A model for wind profile calculation at typical positions of a long street.
Inhomogeneous Wind Scheme for Urban Street (IWSUS) is developed for genrating wind profiles at typical position of a long street. 

The files includes the equations of these wind profiles and am example for a daily variation of heat flux with the use of daily urban surface temperature data in data folder. They has been coupled in WRF/WRF-chem (Verson 4.2.1)by being drived in the land surface schemes. 

To apply the IWSUS in WRF, please unfold the package "Registry"¡¢"phys" and "dyn_em" and replace the files with the same in original folders, then compile again the WRFV3 module. 

The flag "urban_ahs_on=1" should be added in the file namelist.input to call IWSUS scheme.
